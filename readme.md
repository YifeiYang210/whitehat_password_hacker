## Introduction

All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project, you're going to step into the shoes of a hacker, tasked with infiltrating a secret server — password unknown. Your mission is to create a Python program that can crack the password swiftly. Learn how hacking works and create a complex application where you will work on iterators and generators, itertools and time module. 

You will practice your development skills by connecting to a server using the socket module and working with JSON.


## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:
1. Establishing a connection. For starters, let’s pretend the admin's website isn't protected at all. Learn how to connect to the server and receive data from it to access private information.
2. Simple brute force. OK, the admin has pumped up the server and it is now password-protected. But the password is probably short. Let's hack it by applying brute force (and no, that does not mean taking a jackhammer to the physical server!).
3. Smarter, dictionary-based brute force. The admin has picked up on our attempts to access the server, so now it is protected with a more complex password. Maybe the password is long but not unique? Let's hack it using a dictionary of the most common passwords!
4. Catching Exception. The admin is really taking the case seriously. Now it is necessary to specify a valid login and password, and the password cannot be cracked by brute force. And yet, there is a vulnerability in the system that you can exploit to identify the admin's login and password.
5. Time-based vulnerability. The admin has reacted quickly and made a patch that removes the vulnerability. It's time to look for another one.

Other features will be coming soon!
